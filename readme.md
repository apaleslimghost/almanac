## getting started

you will need:

* Ruby 3.0 (i recommend using [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv))
* Probably easiest to install Rails as a system gem idk `gem install rails`
* Node 22 probably via [`volta`](https://volta.sh)
* Postgres (`brew install postgresql ; brew services start postgresql ; createdb ; psql -c 'create database almanac_development;`)
* A [`.env` file](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) with our `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` and `UNSPLASH_SECRET_KEY`

run:

```sh
bundle
npm install
npm start
```

npm runs Rails and the webpack dev server. yeah whatever i'm a node dev really
